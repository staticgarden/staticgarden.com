  <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>


  <h3>Do we use 'cookies'?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

  <p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
  <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
  <h3>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h3>
  <p>Users can visit our site anonymously</p>
  <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
  <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
  <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:On our Privacy Policy Page</p>
  <h3>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h3>
  <p>Users are able to change their personal information:By logging in to their account</p>
  <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
  <h3>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h3>
  <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
  <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
  <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
